        Hi, I'm Kacper. I've been programming for almost 2 years now. I'm most experienced
        with HTML, CSS, JavaScript and React, but there are a couple more technologies I've
        been using. I'm looking for a job as a Junior Frontend Developer. I wouldn't mind
        position that would involve performing some server-side scripting as well, because
        I want to branch out into that area at some point anyway. I'm excited about learning
        more about web development, while performing valuable work for your company.
