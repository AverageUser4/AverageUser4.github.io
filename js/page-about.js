        Hi, I'm Kacper. I've been programming for almost 2 years now. As I believe, that
        quality is more important than quantity, I've been focusing mostly on one field
        - frontend web development. I have really good understanding of core web technologies
        (HTML, CSS and JavaScript) and React library.
        I really enjoy time spent on solving problems and learning new programming concepts.
      </p>
