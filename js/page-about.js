        Hi, I'm Kacper. I'm self-taught programmer with almost 2 years of experience. 
        So far I've been mostly building frontend of web applications (primarily using React),
        but I also have basic experience with server-side scripting. I'm eager to learn and
        my ultimate goal is to become a professional fullstack developer (although currently
        I'm much more well-suited for performing frontend tasks). I'm looking for a job that
        will let me grow as web developer, while bringing substantial value to company that hires me.
      </p>
